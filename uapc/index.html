              <p>The University of Alberta Programming Contest is an opportunity for university, college, and high school students in Alberta to show off their knowledge and skill in a programming competition.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Students will test their knowledge of algorithms and data structures with a set of programming puzzles requiring problem-solving, programming, math, and teamwork skills. </p>

	      <br>

		<p>Two levels of competitions will be held, one for those with less experience to algorithms and
	      one for students who have had prior exposure to contests or are in their later years of university.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The contest is free of charge; lunch will be provided to competitors at the U of A location.</p>

            I will request logins for our Linux machines for those who do not have a CCID. However, to be safe,
            if you do not have a CCID, I suggest you bring a laptop with

            <b>Division 1</b>
            <ul>
              <li> First Place - $300 </li>
              <li> Second Place - $180 </li>

            <b>Grade School</b>
            <ul>
              <li> The highest placing grade school team will receive $150. If there are grade school teams in both divisions 1 and 2, the decision on which team receives the prize will be left to the contest organizers. In the event a grade school team also ranks among the top 3 in their division, they will be given the greater of the grade school award and the ranking award. The contest organizers will then use their discretion to disperse the remaining awards. </li>

            <b>Fun Awards</b>

              <li> A few fun awards are planned as well. Think of them like bonus stars handed out at the end of a Mario Party game! </li>

	      <p>We encourage you to work in teams of three, but you may compete individually or in a team of two.
		
	      <br><br>

	      <p>There will be two divisions: Division 1 is intended for people with some problem-solving experience and Division 2 is intended for people with less problem-solving experience.</p><br>
	      </p>
        <p>
          <b>Division 1 Eligibility Criteria</b><br>
          We will adopt the same cutoffs as the official ICPC. See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gt0gh7e9ubSZOr1ZpZ3liU1g0__fPzg1/view">here</a> for their eligbility flowchart.
          Anyone who passes this criteria can register for Division 1: all team members must qualify. Grade school students are always eligible for Div 1. If you fail the criteria but only by "a bit", you can email the contest organizer (Zac Friggstad)
          to ask for an exception. For example, perhaps your studies were delayed or you have spent a long time in internships.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Division 2 Eligibility Criteria</b><br>
          The eligibility criteria is a bit different this year and is tailored more around seniority and experience.
          To compete in division 2, <b>all</b> members of your team must:
          <ul>
            <li>Be within in their first two years of undergraduate studies, or in grade school.</li>
            <li>Not have competed in more than two Alberta-based programming contests, which include previous UAPC contests, the Rocky Mountaion Regional Contest (RMC), the Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC), the Lethbridge Collegiate Programming Contest (LCPC), and the Calgary Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The second requirement is strict. There may be exceptions for the first one, for example if you are a 3rd year student but the first two years were spent in the Faculty of Arts then you <i>may</i> be considered eligible for Division 2. For questions about eligibility, email the contest organizer (Zac Friggstad).
        </p>
	      <!-- <p>You must register in Division 1 if any team member has <b>completed</b> either CMPUT 204 or CMPUT 275. You may register in Division 1 even if you have not taken these courses. -->
		</p>

	      <br>

	      <p>In each division, the winning team is the one that solves the most problems. Ties are broken by penalty points.</p>
	      <br>
	      <p>
		Penalties points are calculated as follows. For each problem that is <b>accepted</b>, you receive M + 20*W penalty points
		where M is the number of minutes from the start of the contest before your first <b>accepted</b> verdict for this problem
		and W is the number of incorrect submissions for this problem before your first <b>accepted</b> verdict.
